# BrickPythonGame
README for Brick Breaker Python Game by Maggie Jakus and Lisa Hachmann
To run file:
You need to have Pygame, time, random and math imported. 
Time, Random and Math are all part of the standard python library and will not cause issues if you have python installed correctly. 
To install Pygame, write the following in your terminal window:
$ sudo apt-get install python-pygame

To run the game from your terminal window, you need to save "final_game.py", "galaxies.jpg" and "starwarstheme.wav" into one directory. Then, in that directory, you can run the command: 
$ python final_game.py
And the game will start. 

To play the game: 
A new window will pop up and immediately start with a ball moving towards the bricks or player bricks. There will be the Star Wars theme song playing in the background, on loop. To move the player brick, use the arrow keys (left and right) and hit the ball before it reaches the bottom of the screen. If you hit all the bricks successfully then you will move on to the next level. There are 5 levels in total, and to play again after the 5th level, you will need to rerun the program.
